Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements:

The Gaming Room wanted the design of a cross-platform game application called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted the game to be accessible on various platforms and to allow seamless interaction between users. Key software requirements were real-time communication between clients, high performance in rendering images, efficient memory and storage management, strong security measures to protect user data, and scalability to support growing demand.

What I Did Well:

I would say clearly documented the system’s architecture, platform recommendations, and technical considerations in a way that aligned with The Gaming Rooms goals. As well I effectively broke down complex systems—such as distributed architecture, security, and memory management—into actionable and understandable components.

What Was Helpful in the Process:

I would say the design document helped create a clear picture of what was needed. It forced me to think ahead about how the components would interact, which reduced potential issues in the coding phase and helped align the project with user expectations and platform limitations.

What I Would Revise and Improve:

If I were to revise one part it would be the Memory and Storage Management document. I would revise this because although I feel I did well on it, I also feel that I dont fully understand the concepts. So if I was to change something, I would go back and read up on memory and storage management more.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:

I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the client’s goals—cross-platform accessibility, performance, and security—and translated those into system features like platform-independent communication protocols, memory optimization strategies, and secure data handling. Considering user needs is crucial because the success of the software depends on how well it solves the user's problem.

Approach and Future Techniques:

My approach to designing software included identifying core requirements, evaluating platform capabilities, and defining clear system architecture. In future projects, I will continue using this strategy while also applying new strategies I learn in the future. These techniques helped translate client desires into a proper design.
